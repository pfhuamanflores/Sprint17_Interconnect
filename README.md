# Sprint17_Interconnect
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Interconnect, a telecommunications provider. The goal was to identify customers at risk of leaving the company based on behavioral data and service usage patterns. Using a dataset of customer demographics, service features, and historical data, I applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis to gain key insights. After testing several algorithms, I optimized a model that achieved high accuracy in predicting churn. The results can help Interconnect improve customer retention strategies by targeting high-risk customers with personalized interventions.
